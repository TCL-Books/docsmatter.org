> This post explains how to rename tracks in your screencast.

[**PREVIOUS POST**](/post/camtasia-editing-screencast-adding-logo/)

Most screencasts contain background music that helps you create a certain mood, keep yur video interesting, and retain
the interest of your viewers. Let's add some background music to our screencast as well.

We'll use the **mixkit-tech-house-vibes-130.mp3** file as an audio file. You can download this file or use your own
audio file.

To add an audio file to your screencast, do the following:

1.	In the tab area of the Camtasia editor, select the **Media** tab if it is not already selected.

2. Click the plus sign in the lower area of the tab, and then click **Import media**.

![Camtasia - **Import media** function](/images/blog/camtasia-media-tab.png)

* A window opens where you can choose your audio file.

3. Go to the desired folder and select the **mixkit-tech-house-vibes-130.mp3** (or your own audio file).

* The file is loaded into the **Media Bin** and displayed next to the video file and the logo.

4. Click on the audio file and drag it onto the timeline while holding the mouse button pressed. As soon as a blue
frame appears around the track on the timeline, release the mouse button.

5. Drag the audio file to the beginning of the track.

6. Grasp the frame and stretch the audio file to the length of the entire clip.

### Reducing the audio file size

If your audio file is larger than the size of the screencast, you can reduce it by following these steps:

1. Move the mouse cursor to the right edge of the audio file.

* The cursor turns into a double-headed arrow.

![Camtasia - cursor as a double-headed arrow](/images/blog/camtasia-cursor-as-double-headed-arrow.png)

2. Grasp the frame (left-click and hold it) and drag it to the left until it matches the size of the screencast.

3. Release the mouse button.

### Increasing the audio file size

In my case, the size of the audio file is smaller than the screencast size, so at the end of the clip there is some empty space.

![Camtasia - empty space at the end of the screencast](/images/blog/camtasia-empty-space-at-screencast-end.png)

To fill in the empty space, do the following:

1. In the **Media Bin**, click on the audio file and, without releasing it, drag the file on the timeline to the same track where
our audio file is already located.

* Now our track contains the audio file twice.

![Camtasia - adding the audio file again](/images/blog/camtasia-adding-audio-file-again.png)

1: first audio file<br />
2: second audio file

2. If there is an empty space between the audio files, click the second file and drag it to the right border of the first file.
When a vertical yellow line appears between the audio files, release the mouse button.

3. Grasp the right frame of the second audio file (click and hold down the mouse button) and drag it to the left until it matches
the size of the video clip.

4. Release the left mouse button.

* Now the borders of the video and audio file should coincide.

5. Save the project.

### Turning down the volume of the background music

If you listen to the screencast, you notice that the background music is playing too loudly, drowning out our text. To decrease
the volume of the background music, do the following:

1. Click on the first sound track on the timeline.

* The sound track is highlighted in yellow.
* A horizontal green line is displayed on top of the sound waves.

![Camtasia - decreasing the volume of the background music](/images/blog/camtasia-decreasing-music-volume.png)

2. click on the green line and pull the green line down

3.	When the volume is down to 20%, release the mouse button.

4.	Listen to the screencast. If necessary, adjust the volume by moving the green line down or up.

5.	Select the second audio track and decrease the sound (in our case to 20%) by following the steps described above for the first track.

6.	Save the project.

You can also adjust the volume of a particular part of the audio track by selecting the desired area with the slider and dragging the green
line up or down.
