  title : "How it all started"
  content : "Being a senior high school student, I noticed that I have the so-called “language gene” and could learn languages faster and better than the others (at least in my class). So, I decided to go for it and spent
much of my spare time studying English and German.


I further developed my language skills during my studies in different language-related areas at a
pedagogical university. I am particularly proud that I achieved the highest score in each of my final
exams.


In my senior year at university, I started learning about computer science, first by building a simple
website and then taking a course in the BASIC programming language.

After graduating from the
university, I decided to combine both “worlds” (languages and computer science) and apply for a PhD
in computational linguistics. When working on my PhD thesis, I used a wide range of linguistic and
computer research methods to explore how linguistic knowledge could be applied to automatic speech
recognition.


After getting my PhD, I looked for a job where I could apply my knowledge and skills from both fields. I
was lucky enough to find a job as a technical writer at a software company that developed different
virtualization products for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

Looking for new challenges, I moved abroad. In my current job, I’m responsible for creating different
kinds of documentation for enterprise software: Release Notes, Installation Guides, System Requirements,
User and Admin manuals, API documentation etc."
