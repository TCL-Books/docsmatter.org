  content : "Being a senior high school student, I noticed that I have the so-called “language gene” and could learn languages faster and better than the others (at least in my class). So, I decided to go for it and spent
much of my spare time studying English and German.

I further developed my language skills during my studies in different language-related areas at a
pedagogical university. I am particularly proud that I achieved the highest score in each of my final
exams.

In my senior year at university, I started learning about computer science, first by building a simple
website and then taking a course in the BASIC programming language. After graduating from the
university, I decided to combine both “worlds” (languages and computer science) and apply for a PhD
in computational linguistics. When working on my PhD thesis, I used a wide range of linguistic and
computer research methods to explore how linguistic knowledge could be applied to automatic speech
recognition.

After getting my PhD, I looked for a job where I could apply my knowledge and skills from both fields. I
was lucky enough to find a job as a technical writer at a software company that developed different
virtualization products for Linux, Mac, and Windows.

When I started my work, I had no idea about Linux, open-source software, and technical writing. I set
the goal to become an expert in these areas and worked hard to achieve this goal. I taught myself
Linux basics, mastered the command line after a while, completed the Technical Writing Certification,
and was soon promoted to a Senior Technical Writer. I was responsible for the whole documentation
suite for virtualization software running on both Linux and bare-metal servers. Here I also got involved
with my first open-source project – OpenVZ – contributing to its wiki and man pages."
