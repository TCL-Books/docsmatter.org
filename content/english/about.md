  title : "How it all started"
  content : "Being a senior high school student, I noticed that I have the so-called “language gene”. So, I decided to go for it and spent much of my spare time studying English and German. I further developed my language skills during my studies in different language-related areas at a pedagogical university. 


In my senior year at university, I started learning about computer science, first by building a simple
website and then taking a course in the BASIC programming language. After graduating from the
university, I decided to combine both “worlds” (languages and computer science) and apply for a PhD
in computational linguistics. When working on my PhD thesis, I used a wide range of linguistic and
computer research methods to explore how linguistic knowledge could be applied to automatic speech
recognition.


Once I got my PhD, I looked for a job where I could apply my knowledge and skills from both fields. I
was lucky enough to find a job as a technical writer at Parallels, a software company that developed different virtualization products for Linux, Mac, and Windows. Since that moment, my career began to move forward in this direction."
